> What transfers should I make this week?

ü§î Analyzing your team...

Based on my analysis of your team, form, fixtures, and budget:

üìä Current Issues:
- Player X has tough fixtures (AVG FDR: 4.2) for next 3 GWs

üí° Recommended Transfers:
1. OUT: Player X ‚Üí IN: Player Y (Expected gain: +12 pts over 3 GWs)
   Reason: Player Y has excellent fixtures, in top form

üéØ Captain Recommendation for GW 15:
Captain: Haaland (vs Fulham H)
Reasoning: Home fixture, scored in last 3 home games, FDR 2
